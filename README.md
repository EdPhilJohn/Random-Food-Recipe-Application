This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js` and `pages/recipeapi.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## API Used
I have used the Spoonacular API to retrieve all the recipe data. 

Create your API Key in https://spoonacular.com/ and replace them in `pages/recipeapi.js`. 

## To Run the website
run - npm run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
